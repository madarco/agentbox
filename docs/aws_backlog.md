# AWS EC2 provider — build-out status

Live progress tracker for the AWS provider. The design lives in
[`aws-provider-plan.md`](./aws-provider-plan.md); the shared cloud model lives in
[`cloud-providers.md`](./cloud-providers.md).

**Status: Phase 0 done. Phases 1-6 in progress. Phase 7 (live e2e) blocked on an AWS account.**

## Phases

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Registry row (`PROVIDERS`, `types.ts`, `user-config.schema.json`) | done |
| 1 | Package skeleton (client, credentials, setup-iam, security-group, preflight) | todo |
| 2 | `prepare` — the AMI bake | todo |
| 3 | The `CloudBackend` | todo |
| 4 | Wiring (loaders, relay, hub, CLI commands, shipped skills) | todo |
| 5 | Unit tests (mocked SDK) | todo |
| 6 | Docs | todo |
| 7 | Live end-to-end | blocked — needs an AWS account |

## Phase 0 — done

- `packages/config/src/providers.ts` — the `{ name: 'aws', kind: 'cloud', … }` row. Derives
  `ProviderKind`, `PROVIDER_NAMES`, `CLOUD_PROVIDER_NAMES`, the `box.provider` enum, the generated
  `box.imageAws` / `box.sizeAws` / `box.defaultCheckpointAws` KEY_REGISTRY entries, the
  install-wizard picker, and the fork / checkpoint / doctor provider lists.
- `packages/config/src/types.ts` — the four hand-written spots (`UserConfig.box`,
  `EffectiveConfig.box`, `BUILT_IN_DEFAULTS.box`, and KEY_REGISTRY entries for the three AWS-only
  keys).
- `packages/config/schema/user-config.schema.json` — the six new keys (`additionalProperties: false`,
  so a missing key would invalidate any config that sets it).
- `agentbox.yaml` — carry entries for AWS credentials + the `aws-prepared.json` pointer, and an
  `aws-cli` task that installs AWS CLI v2 in-box. See "Dogfooding" below.

New config keys:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `box.imageAws` | `''` | AMI id. Written by `agentbox prepare --provider aws`. |
| `box.sizeAws` | `''` | EC2 instance type (e.g. `t3.medium`). |
| `box.defaultCheckpointAws` | `''` | Per-provider default checkpoint. |
| `box.awsRegion` | `us-east-1` | Region for new boxes. Overridable with `--location`. |
| `box.awsSubnetId` | `''` | Explicit subnet; empty = a public subnet of the default VPC. |
| `box.awsDiskGb` | `40` | Root EBS volume size (EC2's own 8 GB default is too small). |

## Dogfooding (developing the provider inside a box)

`agentbox.yaml` carries a **dedicated** `~/.aws/agentbox-config` + `~/.aws/agentbox-credentials`
pair onto the box's canonical `~/.aws/config` + `~/.aws/credentials`, rather than the host's real
`~/.aws`. The real files hold every profile on the host — including an org's management account —
and carrying them would hand an in-box agent the keys to all of them. Scope the carried pair to one
throwaway AWS account and the box's blast radius is exactly that account.

SSO profiles are **not** carryable: their tokens live in `~/.aws/sso/cache` and only a browser
`aws sso login` refreshes them. The in-box path therefore needs static keys from the isolated
account (the same trade-off the Vercel CLI store has).

The AWS CLI is **not** in the box image — the provider talks to EC2 through `@aws-sdk/client-ec2`,
so the CLI is only needed for the dev loop (exercising the `aws sso login` / `aws iam create-policy`
shell-outs, and sweeping for orphan resources after a live e2e). The `aws-cli` task installs it
in-box on demand, gated on a carried `~/.aws/config`, so a box doing non-AWS work downloads nothing.

## Deferred

- **Cross-region AMI copy.** AMIs are region-scoped; v1 pins boxes to the region the base AMI was
  baked in and fails loud otherwise. `CopyImage` would lift that.
- **Elastic IP.** Would keep a box's public IP stable across stop/start (today the IP changes and the
  SSH ControlMaster is re-established against the new one). Costs money while allocated.
- **True zero-cost pause.** Like Hetzner/DO, a stopped EC2 instance still bills for its EBS volume.
  The real fix is snapshot-and-delete, respawn on resume.
- **Spot instances.** Much cheaper, but an interruption kills the box.
- **Per-project snapshot tier.** Same as the Hetzner/DO story: this *is*
  `checkpoint create --set-default` + `box.defaultCheckpointAws`, not a separate feature.
